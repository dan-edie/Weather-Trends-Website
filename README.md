# Web-Design-Challenge
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap Code

This project was the introduction to writing HTML, CSS, and Boostrap code.

This website is a copy from a previous project using Python and Pandas to create data looking at weather patterns in the
Northern and Southern hemispheres. From that project, only the most relevant data is presented.

The most complicated part of this project was the design. Coding was easy; but making the webpages look the way I wanted
was the challenge. Each website is responsive to window size.

Next Steps:
- Creating websites for previous projects,
- Learning more Bootstrap styles
